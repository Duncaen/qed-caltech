NAME
     qedfile - display or set default qed startup file for user

SYNOPSIS
     qedfile [ -N ] [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
     Qedfile reads "/etc/qedfile" and looks for line
     corresponding to the current user.  It will then display the
     current setting.  If \fIfilename\fR is given the startup
     file is set to that value.

     \fIFilename\fR cannot be 32 characters or longer.

     If the user id is the super user, and the \fIN\fR argument
     is given, the user id is taken to be the value of \fIN\fR.
