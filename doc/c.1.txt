NAME
     c - columnate

SYNOPSIS
     c [-] [-n] [-wN] [file1 ...]

DESCRIPTION
     C reads from the standard input (or the named files) and
     writes to the standard output splitting as many lines as
     possible per line. "-n" sets the line width (default 80).
     If an input line ends in a colon `:', a `break' occurs; thus
     `ls directory1 directory2 | c' causes the listings of
     directories to be columnated separately.  This feature is
     suppressed if the "-" option is present, or if the input is
     from a file.  The "-wN" option sets the maximum number of
     words required to columnate; the default is 2048.  A message
     is printed if space runs out.

EXAMPLES
     ls | c
     nm /net/caltech/unix | c -130 | pr -h "Cal conf" | lpr

DIAGNOSTICS
     "c: out of words": run again, with a larger words space
     size.
     "c: out of memory": tough luck.
     "c: no word space": things are deeply disturbed.
     If a file cannot be read, a message is printed but
     processing continues.
