NAME
     prompt - sets personal default for editor prompting

SYNOPSIS
     prompt [ y ] [ n ]

DESCRIPTION
     Prompt sets the user's own personal default for editor
     prompting.  The argument y gives prompting on, n gives
     prompting off, and no argument at all prints the current
     setting.

     The initial setting for a new user should be y.

     The settings are recorded in the /etc/prompt file, which has
     one line per userid (userid number n is line n+1), with each
     line a single character.  The character is y (for setting y)
     or n (for setting n).
