NAME
     qedbufs - output qed saved structures

SYNOPSIS
     qedbufs [ -n% ] [ prefix ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Qedbufs is used to examine the contents of a Qed(I) "save"
     file.

     The Qed "Sv" command dumps the contents of all buffers into
     a file called "X:aq" where `X' is supplied as part of the
     "Sv" command, or defaulted to `q'.  It also dumps all the
     buffer controls (i.e. the zero, dot & dollar) and the
     register contents into a file called "X:bq".

     Qedbufs outputs some or all of the contents of the "X:bq"
     file where `X' is the argument prefix (default `q').

     The meanings of the flags are:

     -     Equivalent to "-n%". See below.

     -n    print the dot, dollar, cflag, and filename for the
          buffers.

     -%    print the values of the registers.

     The default flag is "-n".  The "-%" flag suppresses the "-n"
     flag, unless explicitly given.

BUGS
     Depends critically on defined constants in Qed, so if Qed
     changes Qedbufs may not work.
