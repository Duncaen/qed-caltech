NAME
     args - copy standard input to argument list and execute

SYNOPSIS
     args ...

DESCRIPTION
     Args creates an argument list from its argument list and the
     lines of its standard input.  Using that argument list it
     tries to execute a command.  It knows about commands in /bin
     or /usr/bin, and about command files.
          For example,         find . -type b -a -print | args ls
     -l
     will list all the block special files under your current
     working directory.

SEE ALSO
     pick (I) -- a useful adjunct to args

DIAGNOSTICS
     Can't exec -- If the programme cannot be found.
     Too many args -- UNIX has a limit of 512 characters in an
     argument list.
