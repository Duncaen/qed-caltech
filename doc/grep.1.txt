NAME
     grep - search a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     grep [ -v ] [ -d ] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -n ] [ -f ] expression [
     file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Grep searches the input files (standard input default) for
     lines matching the regular expression.  Normally, each line
     found is copied to the standard output.  If the -v flag is
     used, all lines but those matching are printed.  If the -d
     flag is used, pattern matching is in dual case ('c' matches
     'c' or 'C').  If the -c flag is used, only a count of
     matching lines is printed.  If the -n flag is used, each
     line is preceded its relative line number in the file.  If
     the -b flag is used, each line is preceded by the block
     number on which it was found.  This is sometimes useful in
     locating disk block numbers by context.

     In all cases the file name is shown if there is more than
     one input file, or if the -f flag is used.

     For a complete description of the regular expression, see ed
     (I).  Care should be taken when using the characters $ * + [
     ^ | ( ) and \ in the regular expression as they are also
     meaningful to the Shell.  It is generally necessary to
     enclose the entire expression argument in quotes.

     Grep's return code is 0 if at least one matching (or, for
     -v, nonmatching) line is found, 1 if none is found, and 2 if
     a file is nonexistent or something is wrong with the
     argument list.

U of T INFO
     Modified by Rob Pike to implement the new pattern matching
     facilities of the U of T version of ed.  The "-f" flag was
     added by Rob Pike.  Henry Spencer added the 0-vs-1 return
     codes (2 was already present) and documented the return
     codes.

BUGS
     Lines are limited to 256 characters; longer lines are
     truncated.
