NAME
     pick - choose which arguments to send to standard output

SYNOPSIS
     pick ...

DESCRIPTION
     Pick prints each of its arguments in turn on the diagnostic
     output and waits for a line to be typed on the user's
     teletype.  If the line starts with a 'y', the argument is
     copied to standard output.  If the line starts with an 'x',
     pick exits.
          Pick is mainly useful in conjunction with args(I).  For
     example:         pick * | args rm -f
     is equivalent to dsw(I).

FILES
     /dev/tty -- to read y's and x's from
